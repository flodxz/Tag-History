    date: '2016-04-15',
    category: 'other',
    description: `Player xXSpeedsterXx discovered a revolutionary new movement technique called "wall-jumping" that changed how TNT Tag was played.

The Technique:
- Utilizing specific block corners to gain extra height
- Combining jumps with precise timing
- Allowing for new escape routes and tag strategies

Impact:
This discovery led to a complete meta shift in high-level play, with players incorporating wall-jumping into their standard strategies. The technique was later officially acknowledged by Hypixel staff as a legitimate strategy.

Training academies began including wall-jumping in their basic curriculum, and new maps were designed with this technique in mind.`,

Concept
In this tournament, the top 8 most skilled players to sign up will be pre selected as team captains. Each captain will draft a team of 5, from a total pool of 32 players.

Pre Selection Group Stage:
Players will be divided into about 8 groups (balanced). Each player will face the others once, in a first-to-5 format. Players with the lowest score in each group will be eliminated.

Captains Selection Process:
Captains will select their teams in a public voice channel of the people that qualified, with the picking order randomized live.

Bracket Stage:
The teams will enter a double-elimination bracket.

Prizes
A huge thanks to our generous sponsors!
ðŸ¥‡ 1st Place: $250 ($50 per player) + Custom Role`,
